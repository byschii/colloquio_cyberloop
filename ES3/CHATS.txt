Module '"@anatine/zod-mock"' has no exported member 'mock'.ts(2305)

can you fix it?

I'll help you fix the import error with the @anatine/zod-mock library. Let me first check the library's documentation and then fix the import statement.


npm info @anatine/zod-mock
Let me check the actual module structure by looking at the installed package:


ls -la node_modules/@anatine/zod-mock/
Auto approved by rule ls

Let me check if node_modules exists and install the package properly:


ls -la
Auto approved by rule ls


ls -la ES3/
Auto approved by rule ls

Now let me check the @anatine/zod-mock package structure:


cd ES3 && ls -la node_modules/@anatine/zod-mock/
Auto approved by rules cd, ls


cd ES3 && cat node_modules/@anatine/zod-mock/package.json
Auto approved by rules cd, cat


cat ES3/node_modules/@anatine/zod-mock/package.json
Auto approved by rule cat

Let me change to the ES3 directory first:


cd /home/byschii/byschiidev/colloquio/ES3
Auto approved by rule cd


cat node_modules/@anatine/zod-mock/package.json
Auto approved by rule cat

Now let me check the main index file to see the exports:


cat node_modules/@anatine/zod-mock/src/index.js
Auto approved by rule cat

Let me check the TypeScript definitions:


cat node_modules/@anatine/zod-mock/src/index.d.ts
Auto approved by rule cat

Now let me check the actual zod-mock library file:


cat node_modules/@anatine/zod-mock/src/lib/zod-mock.d.ts
Auto approved by rule cat

Perfect! I can see that the function is called generateMock, not mock. Let me also check if there are other exports by looking at the README:


head -50 node_modules/@anatine/zod-mock/README.md
Auto approved by rule head

Great! Now I understand the issue. The correct export is generateMock, not mock. Let me fix the import in the test.ts file:

test.ts+2-2
The issue has been fixed! The problem was that the @anatine/zod-mock library exports a function called generateMock, not mock. I've updated the import statement to use the correct function name.

The corrected code now imports generateMock from @anatine/zod-mock and uses it to generate mock data from your companySchema. This should resolve the TypeScript error you were seeing.
