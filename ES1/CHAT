I'll help you transform this into a todo list application with the features you requested. Let me modify the page to include a todo list with a list name, checkable/removable items, and an input for adding new items.

page.tsx+15-2
I need to update the component body to use the todo list state instead of the old counter and name state. Let me fix this:

page.tsx+84-22
Perfect! I've transformed your page into a fully functional todo list application with all the features you requested:

Features Implemented:
List Name: The title is now editable - you can click on it and change the name of your todo list
Checkable Items: Each todo item has a checkbox that you can click to mark as completed/uncompleted
Removable Items: Each item has an "Ã—" button to delete it
Input for New Items: There's an input field at the top where you can type new tasks and either click "Add" or press Enter
Visual Feedback: Completed items are crossed out and have a different background color
Task Counter: Shows how many tasks are remaining vs total
Key Features:
State Management: Uses Jotai atoms for managing the list name and todos
Clean UI: Uses shadcn/ui components for a polished look
Responsive Design: Works well on different screen sizes
Keyboard Support: Press Enter in the input to quickly add items
Visual States: Clear indication of completed vs incomplete tasks
The app starts with a few sample todos to demonstrate the functionality. You can immediately start adding, checking off, and removing items. The list name at the top is also editable - just click on it to change it to whatever you'd like!

remove 'useState' go only with jotai

I'll check the current file contents and remove the useState usage, replacing it with Jotai atoms only.

Read page.tsx, lines 1 to 30

Now I'll remove the useState import and replace the newItemText state with a Jotai atom:

page.tsx+0-1
Now I'll add a Jotai atom for the new item text and update the component to use it:

page.tsx+1-0
Now I'll update the component to use the Jotai atom instead of useState:

page.tsx+1-1
Perfect! I've successfully removed the useState import and replaced it with Jotai atoms only. Here's what I changed:

Removed the useState import - No longer importing React's useState hook
Added newItemTextAtom - Created a new Jotai atom to manage the new item text input state
Updated the component - Changed from useState("") to useAtom(newItemTextAtom)
Now your entire application state is managed exclusively through Jotai atoms:

listNameAtom - for the todo list name
todosAtom - for the array of todo items
newItemTextAtom - for the new item input text
This provides a more consistent state management approach throughout your application and takes full advantage of Jotai's capabilities!
